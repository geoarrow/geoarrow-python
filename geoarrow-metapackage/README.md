# geoarrow

This is a metapackage for the geoarrow namespace.

The `geoarrow` Python libraries are distributed with [namespace packaging](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/), meaning that each python package `geoarrow-[submodule-name]` (imported as `geoarrow.[submodule-name]`) can be published to PyPI independently.

In order to obtain relevant modules, you should install them from PyPI directly, e.g.:

```
pip install geoarrow-pyarrow
```
